  CRS is dedicated to improving the productivity and efficiency of the Assistive
  Technology Practitioner (ATP).  We are developing new technology that allows
  the ATP to document, visualize and share information in a secure collaborative
  environment.  Better information that is more easily shared throughout the
  process of providing Complex Rehab Technologies will result in better
  outcomes.
